# ü§ñ Eurobots 2025 ‚Äì Embedded Systems Project

Welcome to the official repository for our participation in **Eurobots 2025**, part of the **Embedded Project** course.  
This project was developed by a team of six students:

- Ibrahim Zian  
- Samir Bouchrit  
- Haitam Lebatte  
- Soraya Jelti  
- Timoth√© Couturier  
- Yllke Prebreza

## üéÆ Context: *The Show Must Go On*

This repository contains all the code used for the **Eurobots 2025** competition:  
**‚ÄúThe Show Must Go On‚Äù**

Each match lasts **100 seconds**.

- The **Big Robot** can start **immediately**. To score points, it must:
  - **Deploy a banner**
  - **Reach its final zone** before the match ends

- The **Pamis** and the **Superstar** can only start from the **85th second**.
  - The **Pamis** must move to one of the **three target zones** in front of the stage.
  - The **Superstar** must **climb the stage** and advance **as far as possible**.

- After 100 seconds, **all robots must stop** automatically.

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of the project was to design and build multiple coordinated robots with distinct behaviors to accomplish various game tasks.  
This work combines **embedded systems**, **low-level programming**, **robotic mechanics**, and **team-based technical project management**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

This repository is divided into several folders corresponding to each robot and its core functionality.  
Each contains a `README.md` with detailed explanations of its purpose and code.

- [`/Big_Robot's_Code/`](./Big_Robot's_Code/) ‚Äì Readme for the big robot (movement, obstacle avoidance, decision-making).
- [`/Big_Robot's_Code-Banner_Deployment/`](./Big_Robot's_Code-Banner_Deployment/) ‚Äì Readme for the banner deployment system.
- [`/Pami2's_Code/`](./Pami2's_Code/) ‚Äì Readme of the "groupie" robots.
- [`/superstar/`](./superstar/) ‚Äì Readme of the Superstar robot.

## üß† For Future Teams

This repository is also intended as a **resource for future teams** working on similar projects or competitions.  
You‚Äôll find real-world examples of multi-robot coordination, real-time logic, and embedded software architecture.
