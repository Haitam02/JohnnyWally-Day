# 3D Printable Parts – Robotics Project Components

This folder contains `.stl` files for 3D-printable components used in a robotics or embedded mechanical system. Each file corresponds to a specific part designed to be printed and assembled into larger submodules. Parts include supports for sensors, mechanical linkages, structural frames, and power supply mounts.

## 📄 File Overview

- `bas_pami.stl` – Base component for the PAMI  
- `haut_pami.stl` – Top part or cover for the PAMI  
- `IR_pami.stl` – Mount for infrared sensor for the PAMI  
- `IR_vertical_superstar.stl` – Vertical IR sensor support for the Superstar  
- `bas_superstar.stl` – Base platform for the Superstar  
- `bille_folle.stl` – Rolling ball support (for omnidirectional motion); adjusts height on metallic support  
- `support_2_US_superstar.stl` – Dual ultrasonic sensor mount for the Superstar  
- `support_pile_9V.stl` – 9V battery holder  
- `tige_servo.stl` – Rod or arm to be connected to a servo motor  
- `tirette_demarrage.stl` – Piece to keep both parts of the pull tab in correct position when closed  
- `US_Pami.stl` – Ultrasonic sensor holder for the PAMI module  
- `US_Robot.stl` – General ultrasonic sensor holder for the robot  
- `US_Robot_corner.stl` – Corner-mounted ultrasonic sensor holder for the robot

## 🖨️ Printing Guidelines

- **Material:** PLA recommended for general use, PETG for higher durability  
- **Layer Height:** 0.2 mm  
- **Infill:** 20–40% (adjust based on strength requirements)  
- **Supports:** Some files (especially sensor mounts) may require support structures

## 🔧 Assembly Instructions

- Clean all parts post-printing to remove residual support material.  
- Ensure tight fits; use M3 screws and brass inserts where applicable.  
- Parts such as `tige_servo.stl` and `tirette_demarrage.stl` interact with motors or mechanisms — verify motion clearance before final assembly.  
- Sensor holders (`IR_`, `US_`) should be oriented to maintain unobstructed field-of-view for reliable measurements.
