3D Printable Parts – Robotics Project Components

This folder contains .stl files for 3D-printable components used in a robotics or embedded mechanical system. Each file corresponds to a specific part designed to be printed and assembled into larger submodules. Parts include supports for sensors, mechanical linkages, structural frames, and power supply mounts.

-- File Overview --

bas_pami.stl                Base component for the PAMI
haut_pami.stl	              Top part or cover for the PAMI
IR_pami.stl 	              Mount for infrared sensor for the PAMI
IR_vertical_superstar.stl	  Vertical IR sensor support for the Superstar
bas_superstar.stl	          Base platform for the Superstar
bille_folle.stl	            Rolling ball support (for omnidirectional motion) to adjust the height on the metalic support
support_2_US_superstar.stl	Dual ultrasonic sensor mount for the Superstar
support_pile_9V.stl	        9V battery holder
tige_servo.stl	            Rod or arm to be connected to a servo motor
tirette_demarrage.stl	      Piece to keep both parts of the pull tab at the correct position when closed
US_Pami.stl	                Ultrasonic sensor holder for the PAMI module
US_Robot.stl	              General ultrasonic sensor holder for the robot
US_Robot_corner.stl	        Corner-mounted ultrasonic sensor holder for the robot

-- Printing Guidelines --

Material: PLA recommended for general use, PETG for higher durability.
Layer Height: 0.2 mm
Infill: 20–40% (adjust based on strength requirements)
Supports: Some files (especially sensor mounts) may require support structures.

-- Assembly Instructions --
Clean all parts post-printing to remove residual support material.
Ensure tight fits; use M3 screws and brass inserts where applicable.
Parts such as tige_servo.stl and tirette_demarrage.stl interact with motors or mechanisms — verify motion clearance before final assembly.
Sensor holders (IR_*, US_*) should be oriented to maintain unobstructed field-of-view for reliable measurements.
